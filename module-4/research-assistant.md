# Research Assistant 研究助手

## Review 回顾

We've covered a few major LangGraph themes:

我们已涵盖若干重要的 LangGraph 主题：

* Memory
  - 记忆

* Human-in-the-loop
  - 人在环路（Human-in-the-loop）

* Controllability
  - 可控性

Now, we'll bring these ideas together to tackle one of AI's most popular applications: research automation.

接下来，我们将整合这些理念，以应对人工智能领域最受欢迎的应用之一：研究自动化。

Research is often laborious work offloaded to analysts.

研究工作通常繁重，常被交由分析师承担。

AI has considerable potential to assist with this.

AI 在辅助此类工作方面具有巨大潜力。

However, research demands customization: raw LLM outputs are often poorly suited for real-world decision-making workflows.

然而，研究需要定制化：原始 LLM 输出往往难以直接适用于现实世界的决策工作流。

Customized, AI-based [research and report generation](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/05/predictions-for-the-future-of-rag/#reports-over-rag) workflows are a promising way to address this.

定制化的、基于 AI 的[研究与报告生成](https://jxnl.co/writing/2024/06/05/predictions-for-the-future-of-rag/#reports-over-rag)工作流是解决此问题的一种有前景的方法。

## Goal 目标

Our goal is to build a lightweight, multi-agent system around chat models that customizes the research process.

我们的目标是围绕聊天模型构建一个轻量级的多智能体系统，以定制研究流程。

`Source Selection`

`源选择`

* Users can choose any set of input sources for their research.
  - 用户可为其研究任意选择一组输入源。

`Planning`

`规划`

* Users provide a topic, and the system generates a team of AI analysts, each focusing on one sub-topic.
  - 用户提供一个主题，系统将生成一支 AI 分析师团队，每位分析师聚焦于一个子主题。

* `Human-in-the-loop` will be used to refine these sub-topics before research begins.
  - 将在研究开始前通过 `人在环路（Human-in-the-loop）` 对这些子主题进行优化。

`LLM Utilization`

`LLM 使用`

* Each analyst will conduct in-depth interviews with an expert AI using the selected sources.
  - 每位分析师将使用所选源，与一位专家级 AI 进行深入访谈。

* The interview will be a multi-turn conversation to extract detailed insights as shown in the [STORM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) paper.
  - 该访谈将采用多轮对话形式，以提取详细见解，如 [STORM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) 论文所述。

* These interviews will be captured in a using `sub-graphs` with their internal state. 
  - 这些访谈将借助 `子图（sub-graphs）` 及其内部状态予以记录。

`Research Process`

`研究流程`

* Experts will gather information to answer analyst questions in `parallel`.
  - 专家将并行地搜集信息，以回答分析师提出的问题。

* And all interviews will be conducted simultaneously through `map-reduce`.
  - 所有访谈将通过 `map-reduce` 同时开展。

`Output Format`

`输出格式`

* The gathered insights from each interview will be synthesized into a final report.
  - 每次访谈所获取的见解将被综合为一份最终报告。

* We'll use customizable prompts for the report, allowing for a flexible output format. 
  - 我们将使用可自定义的提示词生成报告，从而支持灵活的输出格式。

## Conduct Interview 开展访谈

### Generate Question 生成问题

The analyst will ask questions to the expert.

分析师将向专家提问。



```python
import operator
from typing import  Annotated
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

class InterviewState(MessagesState):
    max_num_turns: int # Number turns of conversation
    context: Annotated[list, operator.add] # Source docs
    analyst: Analyst # Analyst asking questions
    interview: str # Interview transcript
    sections: list # Final key we duplicate in outer state for Send() API

class SearchQuery(BaseModel):
    search_query: str = Field(None, description="Search query for retrieval.")
```


```python
question_instructions = """You are an analyst tasked with interviewing an expert to learn about a specific topic. 

Your goal is boil down to interesting and specific insights related to your topic.

1. Interesting: Insights that people will find surprising or non-obvious.
        
2. Specific: Insights that avoid generalities and include specific examples from the expert.

Here is your topic of focus and set of goals: {goals}
        
Begin by introducing yourself using a name that fits your persona, and then ask your question.

Continue to ask questions to drill down and refine your understanding of the topic.
        
When you are satisfied with your understanding, complete the interview with: "Thank you so much for your help!"

Remember to stay in character throughout your response, reflecting the persona and goals provided to you."""

def generate_question(state: InterviewState):
    """ Node to generate a question """

    # Get state
    analyst = state["analyst"]
    messages = state["messages"]

    # Generate question 
    system_message = question_instructions.format(goals=analyst.persona)
    question = llm.invoke([SystemMessage(content=system_message)]+messages)
        
    # Write messages to state
    return {"messages": [question]}
```

### Generate Answer: Parallelization 生成答案：并行化

The expert will gather information from multiple sources in parallel to answer questions.

专家将并行地从多个来源搜集信息，以回答问题。

For example, we can use:

例如，我们可以使用：

* Specific web sites e.g., via [`WebBaseLoader`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/web_base)
  - 特定网站（例如，通过 [`WebBaseLoader`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/web_base)）

* Indexed documents e.g., via [RAG](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/retrieval)
  - 已索引文档（例如，通过 [RAG](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/retrieval)）

* Web search
  - 网络搜索

* Wikipedia search
  - 维基百科搜索

You can try different web search tools, like [Tavily](https://tavily.com/).

您可以尝试不同的网络搜索工具，例如 [Tavily](https://tavily.com/)。



```python
def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")
```


```python
# Web search tool
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch  # updated 1.0

tavily_search = TavilySearch(max_results=3)
```


```python
# Wikipedia search tool
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WikipediaLoader
```

Now, we create nodes to search the web and wikipedia.

现在，我们创建用于网络和维基百科搜索的节点。

We'll also create a node to answer analyst questions.

我们还将创建一个用于回答分析师问题的节点。

Finally, we'll create nodes to save the full interview and to write a summary ("section") of the interview.

最后，我们将创建用于保存完整访谈内容以及撰写访谈摘要（即“章节”）的节点。



```python
from langchain_core.messages import get_buffer_string

Your task is to create a short, easily digestible section of a report based on a set of source documents.

1. Analyze the content of the source documents: 
- The name of each source document is at the start of the document, with the <Document tag.
        
2. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers
        
3. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (### header)
c. Sources (### header)

4. Make your title engaging based upon the focus area of the analyst: 
{focus}

5. For the summary section:
- Set up summary with general background / context related to the focus area of the analyst
- Emphasize what is novel, interesting, or surprising about insights gathered from the interview
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them
- Do not mention the names of interviewers or experts
- Aim for approximately 400 words maximum
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents
        
6. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

### Sources
[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name

7. Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
[4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

[3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

- Ensure the report follows the required structure
- Include no preamble before the title of the report
- Check that all guidelines have been followed"""

## Accelerating AI Product Development with LangGraph

### Summary

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI technology, startups like Alex's are constantly seeking innovative frameworks to streamline development processes, reduce costs, and accelerate time-to-market for new AI products. LangGraph emerges as a compelling solution, offering a graph-based architecture that enhances the development of AI agents by enabling complex decision-making and multi-agent coordination. This report explores the advantages of adopting LangGraph as an agent framework, highlighting its potential to revolutionize AI product development.

LangGraph distinguishes itself from traditional linear coding frameworks by allowing developers to construct agent behaviors in a graphical form. This approach is particularly beneficial for AI agents that require backtracking or managing complex multi-step tasks [1]. The framework's orchestration capabilities, which include both declarative and imperative APIs, provide a robust platform for developing AI solutions that require short-term and long-term memory storage, human-in-the-loop processes, and fault tolerance [2]. These features are crucial for creating reliable, production-ready AI systems.

One of the most novel aspects of LangGraph is its ability to maintain state and handle cyclical processes, which traditional frameworks often struggle with. This capability allows AI agents to revisit previous steps, adapt to changing conditions, and maintain context throughout extended interactions [3]. For instance, a global technology company successfully implemented a LangGraph-based customer support agent, significantly improving their approach to complex technical issues [3].

LangGraph's integration with the LangChain ecosystem further enhances its utility by providing developers with the building blocks to transition from prototype to production-ready systems. This integration supports the development of multi-turn conversation systems and collaborative agent ecosystems where context and decision-making are paramount [4]. By leveraging LangGraph, startups can move beyond the limitations of single-turn prompts, orchestrating agent interactions and managing memory through a graph-based architecture [5].

In summary, LangGraph offers a transformative approach to AI agent development, enabling startups to streamline their processes and bring innovative AI products to market more efficiently. Its graph-based architecture, combined with the orchestration capabilities and integration with LangChain, positions LangGraph as a leading framework for developing stateful, complex AI systems.
